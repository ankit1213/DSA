Problem:
You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target.
Return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume:

Each input has exactly one solution.

You may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Follow-up: Can you do it in O(n) time?
